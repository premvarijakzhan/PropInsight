This merit-based selection process ensures that scarce agricultural land is awarded to farmers who demonstrate both superior productivity potential and innovative farming concepts.Fixed Price TenderThe Fixed Price Tender is a single-stage tender. Evaluation is conducted by a Tender Evaluation Committee, and the tender is awarded based on proposals that can best optimise the land for production.Concept and Price TenderThe Concept and Price Tender is a two-stage tender. In the first stage, a Concept Evaluation Committee will evaluate the concept proposal based on assessment criteria. Once the proposal passes the first stage, the Tender Evaluation Committee will evaluate the Tendered Sale Price for the award of the tender.Evaluation MethodEach proposal is assessed based on its merits, including production track record and capability, relevant farming experience and qualifications, as well as business sustainability. The evaluation criteria are as follows:Track record (20%)Production capability (60%)Business sustainability (20%)Past Tender ResultsPlease refer tohistorical data on SFA land tenders.For more informationYou can contact us atLandsales@sfa.gov.sg.Last Updated 18 Aug 2025NextSea Tenders for Food Farming﻿Is this page helpful?YesNoThank you for your feedback!We’re sorry to hear that.What issue(s) did you face with this page?Please select:Please let us know your thoughtsThe information on this page is not easy to understand.The information on this page is irrelevant to my needs.There is too much information on this page.Others (please specify)SubmitThank you for your feedback.
