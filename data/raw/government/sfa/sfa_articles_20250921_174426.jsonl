PPWC is the nation’s largest wholesale centre for fruits,      vegetables, and dried goods while JFP is Singapore’s only fishery port.As the current leases of PPWC and JFP will be      expiring in 2026 and 2030 respectively, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA)      has been working with relevant agencies to extend the leases of both PPWC      and JFP to 2040. These extensions are to ensure a continued and resilient      food supply chain for Singapore.Jurong Fishery Port (JFP)The JFP will have its lease extended to 2040. The extension to 2040 will allow SFA’s tenants      within JFP to plan, invest, and upgrade with confidence.Pasir Panjang Wholesale CentreIn order to secure PPWC’s lease extension to      2040, PPWC must rectify all fire-safety non-compliances by end-2026.Progress To Date.SFA has completed the installation of sprinklers      in common areas and linear heat detectors in shops, laying the foundation      for broader rectification works. The only outstanding rectification works      involve some of the shops.Approximately 200 shops out of 1,200 in the PPWC      will be required to undertake fire safety compliance works which include      regularising past Addition & Alteration (A&A) modifications made      by the lessees without SFA approval as well as installing in-unit      sprinkler systems. These rectifications are critical to ensure the safety      of tenants, workers and the public visiting PPWC. Since 2022, SFA has been      working closely with tenants and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)      to progressively address fire safety requirements.Next Phase of Works.Building on earlier efforts, SFA will complete      the Addition & Alteration (A&A) regularisation exercise      progressively between now and end-2026. This will include:Demolishing non-fire safety compliant assets       from units to facilitate the installationof sprinklers;Installing in-unit sprinklers for each shop; andSecuring fire-safety approvals for the entire       PPWC once the entire sprinkler system is properly tested.Support for Tenants.SFA will bear the cost of installing sprinklers at the      ceiling of each shop (i.e. 1stlevel sprinklers) and demolish      existing chillers/assets which are non-fire safety compliant. In addition, affected tenants will receive three      months’ rent and Service & Conservancy Charges waivers. Swing spaces      will be allocated to ensure continuity of trade.Co-funding support would be provided to tenants who need to reinstall their chillers.To ensure quality and minimise disruption, SFA-appointed contractors      are working closely with the PPWC Association and affected tenants —      reviewing unit layouts, polling their operational needs, and sequencing      works in consultation with them. Tenants who do not wish to continue their      leases may opt to exit without reinstatement obligations.Management of common area -Over time, some tenants have also expanded their      trading activities into common spaces, affecting escape routes and      obstructing fire safety provisions. These encroachments create fire      hazards that must be rectified. SFA will work with SCDF to ensure that      these fire hazards are rectified, to provide a safer environment for      the tenants and visitors.Ensuring Food Supply ResilienceSFA is committed to ensuring Singapore's food      supply resilience by strengthening critical food supply nodes,      diversifying import sources, and building long-term resilience in      Singapore's agri-food trade. The lease extensions for both PPWC and JFP      will enable SFA and relevant agencies to strengthen food supply chains      supporting Singapore's agri-food trade.Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and      the Environment, Mr Zaqy Mohamad said, “Ensuring a continued supply of safe food for Singapore      and Singaporeans is a key priority. It is therefore crucial for these      facilities to be upgraded, rejuvenated and future-ready, to support      resiliency in Singapore’s food supply chain. At the same time, ensuring      the safety of tenants, customers and other stakeholders operating at our      facilities is also of paramount importance. Hence, we must do the      necessary rectifications in PPWC in accordance with mandatory fire safety      requirements. Though there may be some inconveniences during the      regularisation works at PPWC, SFA will continue to work closely with      stakeholders involved and provide the necessary assistance to ensure      business continuity and minimise disruptions.”Annex A – About PPWC and JFPPPWC, opened in 1983 by the Ministry of Nati", "timestamp": "2025-08-29T05:00:00+08:00", "url": "https://www.sfa.gov.sg/news-publications/newsroom/extension-of-lease-for-pasir-panjang-wholesale-centre---jurong-fishery-port-to-2040", "language": "en", "metadata": {"title": "Extension of Lease for Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre & Jurong Fishery Port to 2040", "agency": "SFA", "category": "wholesale_infrastructure", "content_length": 5000, "keywords": ["wholesale centre", "fishery port", "Pasir Panjang", "Jurong", "lease extension", "supply chain"], "press_release_id": null, "policy_type": "lease_extension", "policy_subtype": "wholesale_facilities", "facilities": ["Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre", "wet market", "Jurong Fishery Port"], "lease_duration": "2040", "infrastructure_type": "food_distribution", "regional_impact": ["common area", "Jurong", "Pasir Panjang"], "supply_chain_security": true, "long_term_commitment": true}}

Illegally imported produce and food products of unknown sources can pose a food safety risk. Food can only be imported by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied with a valid import permit.6            Offenders who illegally import fresh fruits and vegetables shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.7            Safeguarding Singapore’s borders remains a top priority for ICA.

During the operation, ICA officers at Woodlands Checkpoint noticed discrepancies in the consignment transported by a truck and referred it to SFA for further checks.3          SFA found under-declared vegetables in the truck such as eggplants, cucumbers and long beans imported by one importer. All illegally imported produce were seized.4           SFA is following up with further investigations and will not hesitate to take enforcement action.Truck drivers unloading imports for inspection (left) and all illegal imports are seized (right) (Photos: SFA)5            In Singapore, food imports must meet SFA’s requirements. Illegally imported produce of unknown sources can pose a food safety risk. Food can only be imported by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied with a valid import permit.6            Offenders who illegally import fresh vegetables shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.7            Safeguarding Singapore’s borders remains a top priority for ICA. ICA will continue to conduct security checks to detect and deter illegal importation attempts to keep Singapore safe. SFA will continue to safeguard food safety through our integrated food safety system, which includes strict import regulations and enforcement, and work closely with border control agencies to deter illegal importation across our borders.Issued by the Singapore Food Agencyand the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority25 July 2025We welcome your feedbackHelp us improve your experience on SFA's revamped corporate website by doing a 5-minute survey.Let's goWhich of the following best describes you?I work in thefood industryCheck any that apply:Food FarmerFood Trader (Importer / Exporter)Food RetailerFood ManufacturerOthers (please specify)I work in aregional / international body that regulates the food industryI am in themedia industryI am aresearcherI am aneducatorI am aSingapore Public ServantI am a member of thepublicI am atourist or travellerOthers (please specify)NextWhich of the following best describes the reason for your visit to our website?Learn about SFAUse tools and resources (e.g. search database, calculators, guides)Use eServices (e.g. apply / renew / make payment)Get the latest news related to the food industryGet the latest information on events related to the food industryLook for food-related publications (e.g. Singapore Food Statistics)Look for food-related legislationContact SFA to give feedback / submit enquiryOthers (please specify)NextWere you able to locate the information or services you needed today?YesYes, but with some difficultyPlease tell us why.The website was difficult to navigate.

We maintain a comprehensive strategy to safeguard our nation's food security, through (i) source diversification; (ii) stockpiling; and (iii) local production, to counter potential disruptions brought about by factors such as climate change, the spread of animal-borne diseases, geopolitical tensions, and transformations in international trade dynamics.Import source diversification will continue to be our core strategy to reduce our reliance on any single source and to strengthen food security. We have increased import sources over the years and currently import from 187 countries/regions.We have also made good progress in stockpiling, which is another strategy to ensure food security in Singapore. We collaborate closely with our industry partners to maintain stockpiles of essential food items for emergencies and had updated our legislative framework as part of the Food Safety and Security Act to strengthen our food security system.Local production serves as a form of insurance and buffer against overseas supply disruptions, though there are inherent challenges from higher cost and a challenging global investment environment. SFA will continue to actively support the farming industry's growth through various initiatives such as availing space and infrastructure for farming, facilitating access to funding such as the Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund, and growing demand offtake for local produce with initiatives like the Singapore Fresh Produce logo, Farm-to-Table Recognition Programme, and supply-demand aggregation efforts (e.g., SG Farmers’ Market, The Straits Fish) through the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation (SAFEF). The 2024 figures show encouraging progress in some areas, particularly in egg production, where local farms have improved their efficiency and production and now supply 34% of our consumption needs. While vegetable and seafood production remain modest at 3% and 6% of our consumption respectively, both sectors have shown improved productivity in terms of production per hectare.Consumers and businesses can also play a part by supporting local produce to help secure Singapore’s food future. Local produce may not always be comparable or cheaper in pricing than imports, but it is fresher, lasts longer, incurs less transport miles and many of them are pesticide-free.Cheong Lai Peng張丽萍Senior Director高级署长Industry Development and Community Partnerships行业开发与社区合作部Singapore Food Agency 新加坡食品局Forum reply - 26 June 2025Forum letter by Huang Sen Yong- 17 June 2025We welcome your feedbackHelp us improve your experience on SFA's revamped corporate website by doing a 5-minute survey.Let's goWhich of the following best describes you?I work in thefood industryCheck any that apply:Food FarmerFood Trader (Importer / Exporter)Food RetailerFood ManufacturerOthers (please specify)I work in aregional / international body that regulates the food industryI am in themedia industryI am aresearcherI am aneducatorI am aSingapore Public ServantI am a member of thepublicI am atourist or travellerOthers (please specify)NextWhich of the following best describes the reason for your visit to our website?Learn about SFAUse tools and resources (e.g. search database, calculators, guides)Use eServices (e.g. apply / renew / make payment)Get the latest news related to the food industryGet the latest information on events related to the food industryLook for food-related publications (e.g. Singapore Food Statistics)Look for food-related legislationContact SFA to give feedback / submit enquiryOthers (please specify)NextWere you able to locate the information or services you needed today?YesYes, but with some difficultyPlease tell us why.The website was difficult to navigate.

None were hospitalised.3           MOH and SFA conducted a joint inspection at the food establishment’s premises located at Hillion Mall and found multiple food safety lapses. These included a dirty chiller, which increases the risk of cross contamination in food items, as well as dirty racks and wall tiles, which were indicative of poor food safety standards in the premises.The food safety lapses detected included a dirty chiller (left) and dirty wall tiles (right) (Photos: SFA)4              All food operators should ensure their premises are clean and well-maintained, as well as adhere to proper food hygiene and food safety requirements.

{"id": "sfa_newsroom_-8828392530997828288", "source": "government_sfa", "text": "A-A+Media ReleasesSingapore Food Statistics 202405 Jun 2025The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has published the Singapore Food Statistics(SgFS) 2024, an annual publication of Singapore’s food supply and food safety data over the past 3 years.Key Highlights from 2022 to 2024Diversifying Import Sources2Singapore is a small and open economy which imports more than 90% of our food supply. This leaves us vulnerable to supply chain disruptions in an increasingly volatile and challenging operating environment. To minimise the impact of such disruptions, diversification remains SFA’s core strategy to ensure food security by reducing our reliance on any single source. In 2024, Singapore has increased its food supply sources to 187 countries/regions, up from just 140 around two decades back.3Even as we diversify our food sources, food safety remains key. Accreditation at the source is required for the import of food items that carry higher food safety risks and animal diseases that could impact local public health and trade (e.g., livestock, meat and eggs). In 2024, SFA approved Portugal as a new source for pork, Brunei and Poland as new sources for beef, and Türkiye as a new source for poultry. SFA will continue to facilitate industry connections with commercial food suppliers through sourcing trips and work with the industry to strengthen their supply networks through the implementation of Business Continuity Plans.Building Capability and Capacity for Local Production4Local production is part of our multi-pronged approach towards food security and complements our other strategies. It serves as a form of insurance and buffer by helping to mitigate the impact of overseas food supply disruptions. In 2024, hen shell eggs, vegetable, and seafood farms contributed around 34%, 3%, and 6%, of our total food consumption respectively.5          Local production of hen shell eggs continued to grow, increasing by 13% in 2024 due to farm upgrades and improved operational efficiencies. Likewise, productivity of our egg farms has improved from 14.8 million pieces per hectare per year in 2023 to 16.7 million pieces per hectare per year in 2024. Despite a decline in production of vegetables of about 3%, the productivity has increased from 227.2 tonnes per hectare per year in 2023 to 231.4 tonnes per hectare per year in 2024. The increase in productivity for hen shell eggs and vegetable farms is evident that farms are growing more with less through the adoption of technology and innovative solutions. Partly due to the restructuring of a few fish farms in Singapore, production of seafood declined by 14% in 2024. Nevertheless, productivity of the sector increased slightly from 38.6 tonnes per hectare per year in 2023 to 40.7 tonnes per hectare per year in 2024.6          SFA remains committed to supporting our farms to build capability and capacity for local production. For example, in 2024, SFA introduced plans for the National Broodstock Centre (NBC) and the Hatchery Development and Recognition Programme (HDRP) as part of the refreshed Singapore Aquaculture Plan (SAP). For vegetables, 2025 and 2026 will see the set-up and ramp up of a few large-scale indoor vertical farms. SFA continues to review the Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund to better address our farmers’ diverse and emerging needs. SFA expanded the Farm-to-Table Recognition Programme (FTTRP) which has onboarded more than 100 food businesses to date, so that consumers have more avenues to support local farms by dining at these businesses. Consumers can also play an important role in strengthening food security by supporting local produce.Ensuring Safe Food for All7           There is no food security without food safety. SFA maintains a comprehensive farm-to-fork food safety system, using a science-based risk management approach aligned with international standards. This robust framework includes data-driven inspections and horizon scanning for early alerts on food safety incidents.8               Pending the conclusion of one case still under investigation, the number of foodborne illness cases per 100,000 population in 2024 was 22.8. As more than half of the foodborne illness cases involved catered food, SFA stepped up efforts to carry out further targeted checks on food establishments supplying catered food. In addition, SFA engaged food industry associations to share key insights from these foodborne outbreaks and reminded food establishment operators on good food safety practices.9               SgFS is available for download from SFA’s website atwww.sfa.gov.sg/publications/sgfs.Issued by the Singapore Food Agency5 June 2025About the Singapore Food Agency (SFA)The mission of the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) is to ensure and secure a supply of safefood.

During the operation, ICA officers at Tuas Checkpoint noticed discrepancies in the consignment transported by two trucks and referred them to SFA for further checks.3       SFA found undeclared and under-declared produce such as spring onion, potato, bayam and cut cabbage imported by two importers in the trucks. All illegally imported produce were seized.4       SFA is following up with further investigations and will not hesitate to take enforcement action.Truck drivers unloading imports for inspection. (Photos: SFA)Produce is weighed and the total weight is tallied (Photo: SFA)All illegal imports were seized (Photos: SFA)5       In Singapore, food imports must meet SFA’s requirements. Illegally imported produce and food products are of unknown sources and pose a food safety risk. Food can only be imported by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied with a valid import permit.6       Offenders who illegally import fresh fruits and vegetables shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years.7       Safeguarding Singapore’s borders remains a top priority for ICA. ICA will continue to conduct security checks to detect and deter illegal importation attempts to keep Singapore safe. SFA will continue to safeguard food safety through our integrated food safety system, which includes strict import regulations and enforcement, and work closely with border control agencies to deter illegal importation across our borders.Issued by the Singapore Food Agency and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority30 May 2025We welcome your feedbackHelp us improve your experience on SFA's revamped corporate website by doing a 5-minute survey.Let's goWhich of the following best describes you?I work in thefood industryCheck any that apply:Food FarmerFood Trader (Importer / Exporter)Food RetailerFood ManufacturerOthers (please specify)I work in aregional / international body that regulates the food industryI am in themedia industryI am aresearcherI am aneducatorI am aSingapore Public ServantI am a member of thepublicI am atourist or travellerOthers (please specify)NextWhich of the following best describes the reason for your visit to our website?Learn about SFAUse tools and resources (e.g. search database, calculators, guides)Use eServices (e.g. apply / renew / make payment)Get the latest news related to the food industryGet the latest information on events related to the food industryLook for food-related publications (e.g. Singapore Food Statistics)Look for food-related legislationContact SFA to give feedback / submit enquiryOthers (please specify)NextWere you able to locate the information or services you needed today?YesYes, but with some difficultyPlease tell us why.The website was difficult to navigate.

We also have in place bird flu regionalisation arrangements with Brazil. Under such arrangements, imports from affected establishments and those within a buffer zone may be suspended while those imports from unaffected areas outside the buffer zone can continue.The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) also works with the industry to accredit new sources of poultry that meet our food safety requirements. While our overall supply of poultry is currently stable, we can expect supply fluctuations from time to time due to disease outbreaks and supply disruptions. For instance, several countries are affected by bird flu outbreaks which affected their poultry production.Source diversification remains a key food security strategy for Singapore. Diversification reduces the impact of disruption from any single source as our importers can turn to alternative sources quickly to stabilise our food supply. Other than poultry from Brazil, which is one of our top sources of poultry, Singapore’s poultry supply is also well-diversified with 30 accredited sources. This includes countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Denmark, and Malaysia. If there are supply disruptions from any source, we will work with the industry to increase chilled and frozen chicken supply from other sources if necessary.The food industry is encouraged to diversify and import from various sources and take steps to contribute to our resilience by implementing Business Continuity Plans. Consumers are also encouraged to be flexible with their food options in the event of disruption.Keeping out bird fluThe Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS), a cluster of the National Parks Board, is also working closely with SFA to stay vigilant and put in place precautionary measures to prevent the incursion of bird flu.These measures include horizon scanning for information related to bird flu worldwide and in the region, engagement with overseas authorities, source accreditation and import control for imported poultry and poultry products, inspections and biosurveillance of imported birds at local farms, poultry slaughterhouses, wild birds, and ornamental bird shops. For example, AVS conducts regular checks and sampling of migratory birds to test for bird flu.All imported poultry and poultry products, including eggs, must also come from sources accredited by SFA. We suspend import from regions affected by bird flu or only allow products that have been heat treated to inactivate the bird flu virus.Public advisory on wild birds and bird fluWhile Singapore remains free from bird flu, it is endemic in the region, highlighting the need for Singapore to be vigilant in our biosurveillance and biosecurity programme. People working in close contact with birds are advised to observe good personal hygiene and take necessary measures such as appropriate personal protective equipment when handling them to minimise public health risks.As a precaution, members of the public should not touch or feed wild birds, including free-roaming chickens. Veterinarians and bird owners are also reminded to be on the alert for possible bird flu infections in birds. Members of the public can report suspected cases to AVS via our website atwww.avs.gov.sg/feedbackor by calling our Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600.Issued by SFA and AVS19 May 2025We welcome your feedbackHelp us improve your experience on SFA's revamped corporate website by doing a 5-minute survey.Let's goWhich of the following best describes you?I work in thefood industryCheck any that apply:Food FarmerFood Trader (Importer / Exporter)Food RetailerFood ManufacturerOthers (please specify)I work in aregional / international body that regulates the food industryI am in themedia industryI am aresearcherI am aneducatorI am aSingapore Public ServantI am a member of thepublicI am atourist or travellerOthers (please specify)NextWhich of the following best describes the reason for your visit to our website?Learn about SFAUse tools and resources (e.g. search database, calculators, guides)Use eServices (e.g. apply / renew / make payment)Get the latest news related to the food industryGet the latest information on events related to the food industryLook for food-related publications (e.g. Singapore Food Statistics)Look for food-related legislationContact SFA to give feedback / submit enquiryOthers (please specify)NextWere you able to locate the information or services you needed today?YesYes, but with some difficultyPlease tell us why.The website was difficult to navigate.

This merit-based selection process ensures that scarce agricultural land is awarded to farmers who demonstrate both superior productivity potential and innovative farming concepts.Fixed Price TenderThe Fixed Price Tender is a single-stage tender. Evaluation is conducted by a Tender Evaluation Committee, and the tender is awarded based on proposals that can best optimise the land for production.Concept and Price TenderThe Concept and Price Tender is a two-stage tender. In the first stage, a Concept Evaluation Committee will evaluate the concept proposal based on assessment criteria. Once the proposal passes the first stage, the Tender Evaluation Committee will evaluate the Tendered Sale Price for the award of the tender.Evaluation MethodEach proposal is assessed based on its merits, including production track record and capability, relevant farming experience and qualifications, as well as business sustainability. The evaluation criteria are as follows:Track record (20%)Production capability (60%)Business sustainability (20%)Past Tender ResultsPlease refer tohistorical data on SFA land tenders.For more informationYou can contact us atLandsales@sfa.gov.sg.Last Updated 18 Aug 2025NextSea Tenders for Food Farming﻿Is this page helpful?YesNoThank you for your feedback!We’re sorry to hear that.What issue(s) did you face with this page?Please select:Please let us know your thoughtsThe information on this page is not easy to understand.The information on this page is irrelevant to my needs.There is too much information on this page.Others (please specify)SubmitThank you for your feedback.
